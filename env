# This file sets environment variables that should be globally set on the system
# That is, across graphical and non-graphical logins, and across all shell types
#
# Note that it is _not_ important to set things like FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND here since
# that is only relevant when using an interactive shell, so we may as well just set
# that directly in the shell config.
